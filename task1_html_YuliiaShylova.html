			<h2>Ocicat</h2>

			</figure>
			<p>Ocicats have almond shaped eyes, large, strong bodies, muscular legs with 
			dark markings, and powerful, oval shaped paws. Their heads have a wedge 
			shape, that is, longer than wide. Their ears are tilted at a 45 degree 
			angle. One of the most striking things about these cats is the dark 
			contrasting spots. The body shape of the Ocicat is partway between the 
			svelte Oriental and the sturdy American Shorthair. The breed's large, 
			well-muscled body gives an impression of power and strength, and is greater 
			in weight than expected by appearance. Twelve variants in color are approved 
			by most registries, including The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc. standard 
			for the Ocicat breed: tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, their dilutes, blue, 
			lavender and fawn, black silver (or ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon 
			silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver.</p>

			<p>The Selkirk Rex is distinct from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex 
			and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There 
			are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that 
			the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple 
			dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely 
			dominant, allele pairs produce three possible genotypes and phenotypes: 
			heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show 
			ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat 
			volume.</p>

				<figcaption>Japanese Bobtail</figcaption>
			</figure>			
			<p>The Japanese Bobtail is a breed of domestic cat with an unusual "bobbed" 
			tail more closely resembling the tail of a rabbit than that of other cats. 
			The variety is native to Japan and Southeast Asia, though it is now found 
			throughout the world. The breed has been known in Japan for centuries, and 
			it frequently appears in traditional folklore and art. As in most other breeds, 
			Japanese Bobtails may have almost any color (or colors, arranged in any number 
			of patterns). Predominantly-white calicoes are especially favored by 
			the Japanese and by cat fanciers, and strongly represented in folklore, though 
			other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.</p>

				<img src="images/toyger.jpg" alt="Toyger" width="230" height="230">

			</figure>			
			<p>The toyger is a breed of domestic cat, the result of breeding domestic 
			shorthaired tabbies (beginning in the 1980s) to make them resemble 
			a "toy tiger", as its striped coat is reminiscent of the tiger's. The breed's 
			creator, Judy Sugden, has stated that the breed was developed in order to 
			inspire people to care about the conservation of tigers in the wild. It was 
			recognized for "registration only" by The International Cat Association in the 
			early 1990s, and advanced through all requirements to be accepted as a full 
			championship breed in 2007. There are about 20 breeders in the United States 
			and another 15 or so in the rest of the world, as of 2012.</p>

			<h2>American Curl</h2>

				<img src="images/american_curl.jpg" alt="American Curl" width="230" height="230">
				<figcaption>American Curl</figcaption>
			</figure>			
			<p>The American Curl is a breed of cat characterized by its unusual ears, 
			which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. 
			An American Curl's ears should be handled carefully because rough handling 
			may damage the cartilage in the ear. The breed originated in Lakewood, 
			California, as the result of a spontaneous mutation. The first American Curls 
			appeared as strays on the door step of the Rugas in Lakewood, California in 
			June 1981. The black female, named Shulamith, gave birth to a litter of cats 
			with the same curled ears, and so became the ancestor of all American Curls 
			today. In 1986, an American Curl was exhibited at a cat show for the first 
			time, and in 1992, the longhaired American Curl was given championship status 
			by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became 
			the first breed admitted to the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship 
			Class with both longhair and shorthair divisions.</p>

				<figcaption>Munchkin</figcaption>
			</figure>			
			<p>The Munchkin or Sausage Cat is a new breed of cat characterized by its 
			very short legs, which are caused by a genetic mutation. Much controversy 
			erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat 
			Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and 
			mobility issues. Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times 
			around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted 
			four generations of healthy short-legged cats which were similar to normal 
			cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during 
			the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia 
			during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The Javanese, also known as the Colorpoint (or Colourpoint) Longhair in 
			some registries (though that name has other meanings), is a variety of 
			purebred domestic cat. It is an Oriental-type, the long-haired equivalent of 
			the Colorpoint Shorthair. The variety was developed in North America; its 
			name is derived from the tradition of naming Oriental-type cats after 
			Southeast Asian places. It is an offshoot of the Balinese breed, out-crossed 
			to Siamese and Colorpoint Shorthair, and often having coat patterns not 
			acceptable in those breeds. Individuals may or may not be have point 
			coloration.</p>
